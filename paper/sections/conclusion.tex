\section{Conclusion}
\ulwem-based apparent gravity offers a unified, multi-scale avenue to explain galaxy rotation curves without particle dark matter. Next steps include implementing and validating the 3D octree model (FDBL), enforcing RJ-based regularization, and expanding to higher-resolution galaxies (e.g., NGC 3198, NGC 2403).
