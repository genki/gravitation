\section{Introduction}
Observed galaxy rotation curves deviate from the expectations of general relativity (GR) with baryonic matter alone. We explore whether an ultra long wavelength electromagnetic field (\ulwem) can induce a bias that manifests as apparent gravity, which we call Future Decoherence Bias (\fdb), reproducing these discrepancies without invoking particle dark matter.
